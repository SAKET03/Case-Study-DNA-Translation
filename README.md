# Case Study1 DNA Translation
 
The NCBI is the National Center for Biotechnology Information, and it is United States' main public repository of DNA and related information.
I will download two files from the NCBI. The first is a strand of DNA and the second is the corresponding protein sequence of amino acids translated from this DNA.
