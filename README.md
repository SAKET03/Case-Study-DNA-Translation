# Case Study: DNA Translation

In this case study, I had four tasks.
1. The first task is to manually download DNA and protein sequence data to your computer.
2. The second task is to import the DNA data into Python.
3. The third task is to create an algorithm that translates to DNA using the translation table we will provide.
4. The fourth task, the final task, is to check if your DNA translation matches the protein string you have downloaded. 
 
I would be using the NCBI which is the National Center for Biotechnology Information, and it is United States' main public repository of DNA and related information. I will download two files from the NCBI. The first is a strand of DNA and the second is the corresponding protein sequence of amino acids translated from this DNA.
